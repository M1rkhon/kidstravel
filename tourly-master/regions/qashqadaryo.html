                The climate in Shakhrisabs is almost the same as in Samarkand.
                It also has a pronounced seasonality. Winter is mild and not cold,
                but it is better to have a woolen sweater in your luggage, because it is cool at night.
                Summer is usually very hot. Sometimes the daytime temperature lasts until midnight.
