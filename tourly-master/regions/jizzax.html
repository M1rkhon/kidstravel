            <div class="title"></div>
            <div class="descr">
                This tour can be done between the main Silk Road cities of Samarkand
                and Bukhara so you will explore off the beaten treks of Uzbekistan while
                traveling from one city to the other rather than just traveling long distances.
                Sayyod Yurt Camp is a good starting point for short and medium length hikes. It is
                also a great place to unwind if you have seen too many mosques and madrassas in the Silk Road cities.

            <div class="descr">
                The climate here is subtropical. If we talk about the best time to travel there,
                we need first to determine our purpose. Having the abundance of coniferous forests,
                Zaamin is excellent place to go for both year-round treatment and prevention, and for winter recreation.
                Not without reason it is often called the "Uzbek Switzerland".
