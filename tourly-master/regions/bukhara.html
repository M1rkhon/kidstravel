      <div class="date">Visit the Ark</div>
      <div class="descr">
        Inside the ark walls, check out the Juma mosque and the exhibitions about Charles Stoddart and Arthur Connelly,
        two British soldiers who were executed outside the ark in 1842.
        If you can get here early you will avoid the larger tour groups.

    <li style="--accent-color:#FBCA3E">
      <div class="date">Visit the Kaylon Mosque and Minaret and Mir-i-Arab Madrasa </div>
      <div class="descr">
        Of the many religious structures in Bukhara, these three are probably
        the most spectacular and definitely the top things to visit in the city.
        Of the three, the Mir-i-Arab is probably the most spectacular.
        Gorgeous tile work adorns its entrance and two glistening blue domes sit either side.
        As the sun sets a gorgeous orange washes over everything making it absolutely spectacular.

    <li style="--accent-color:#E24A68">
      <div class="date">Enjoy Some Shade at Lyabi-Hauz</div>
      <div class="descr">
        The centre of Bukhara emanates from Lyabi-Hauz.
        The plaza was built in 1620 and throughout history has been a place where
        local Uzbeks would congregate to relax and discuss the issues of the day.
        From Lyabi-Hauz make sure you check out the alleyways to the southwest that snake
        around numerous small mosques, crumbling madrasas and plenty of friendly locals inviting you in for cups of tea.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#1B5F8C">
      <div class="date">Check Out Samanidov Park</div>
      <div class="descr">To the west of the Ark you will find Samanidov Park.
        This is a classic Soviet-style park with various statues, walkways,
        and a few dodgy rides here and there.
        Around the park, there are also quite a few mosques and madrasas that are well worth poking your head into.
      </div>
    </li>
    <li style="--accent-color:#4CADAD">
      <div class="date">Visit Chor Minor</div>
      <div class="descr">Chor Minor is quite unique in that it has four decorative
        towers (not minarets) of equal height. It achieved it’s fame thanks to its
        position on the cover of Central Asia’s Lonely Planet.
        Its location, away from the old town’s heart, means it’s away
        from many of the larger tour groups with some interesting back streets to explore on your way there and back.

            </h6>
            <p>
              Out in the city’s northeast, you will find the Emir’s summer palace.
              It was here where Bukhara’s last Emir, Alim Khan would come to get away from it all.
              With the buildings taken care of by Russian architects, the decorating was left to local artisans.
