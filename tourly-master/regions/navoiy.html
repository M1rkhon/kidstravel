                            History Of Navoi
                        </h6>
                        <p>
                            Historically, Navoi was part of the Emirate of Bukhara whose urban
                            centers included the likes of ancient cities of Samarkand and Bukhara.
                            Back then, the city was reportedly named Kermine. Thus this had profound
                            effect on the culture and lifestyle of the people of this region majority
                            of whom were Islam. The iconic Silk Road passed through this city, but whether or
                            not there was a caravanserai in this place is uncertain.
