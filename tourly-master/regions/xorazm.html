            <div class="descr">
                This is probably Khiva’s most well-known sight.
                As soon as you enter the western gate you will be able to see it in all its glory.
                Whereas most minarets are tall, slender, and rather plainly decorated,
                the Kalta Minor Minaret is the exact opposite. It’s short, fat structure is adorned with spectacular turquoise tile work.

                The city walls that set Khiva apart from other Uzbek silk road cities
                like Samarkand and Bukhara. The walls are still in excellent condition
                and it’s possible to walk along the northern and northwestern sections of the city walls.

            <div class="descr">
                After entering the western gate a couple of left-hand turns will bring you to the Kuhna Ark.
                Whilst the name will obviously bring a similar namesake in Bukhara to mind, it is altogether a different architectural feat.

            <div class="descr">
                An early morning stroll around Uzbekistan’s ancient cities is a great way to start the day.
                From May onwards Uzbekistan swelters under the desert heat, with the peak temperatures between 12 pm and 2 pm.
                Getting out early in the morning means you can avoid these temperatures, and see the city come to life.

            <div class="title"></div>
            <div class="descr">
                There is plenty of decent food to be found on Khiva. Central Asian classics can be found in abundance, almost everywhere.
                We arrived late in the evening after a long drive down from Nukus having spent two days at the Aral Sea.
                We wandered into the Ichan Kala and took a seat at the only restaurant that seemed to be open, close to the Kalta Minaret that was spectacularly lit up.

                        <p>
                            There are a number of budget options in Khiva that are quite a walk from the Ichan Kala itself. However, there is a strong argument that the drop in price is not worth it.
                            Therefore the budget option I’ve selected is from the immediate vicinity of the Ichan Kala.
