      <div class="date">Explore Central Tashkent</div>
      <div class="descr">
        There is a lovely walk that takes you from Paxtakor subway station through Central Tashkent,
        taking in some classic Soviet-era architecture before ending up at the Navoi theatre.
        The area around here is full of government buildings for various departments. An excellent demonstration of communist architecture.

      <div class="date">Best Restaurants in Tashkent</div>
      <div class="descr">
        For great Uzbek food, you can’t go wrong with checking out some of the stands at the Chorsu bazaar.
        The plov and shashlik are both excellent.
        Do check the price before ordering as you may end up with a bigger bill than you anticipated.

      <div class="date">Getting Around Tashkent</div>
      <div class="descr">
        Tashkent’s metro is famous for its extravagant designs,
        although not quite at the level of Moscow or St Petersburg there is some fantastic artwork on display.
        Aside from that, it’s taxis or marshrutka.

            </h6>
            <p>
              Generally the months to avoid are June, July and August when Tashkent
              and Uzbekistan swelter under the desert heat.
              Spring and Autumn are excellent times to visit.
