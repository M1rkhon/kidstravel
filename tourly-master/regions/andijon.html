                Most of the year (over 200 days), the weather is warm and dry.

            <div class="descr">
                The Jami Madrasa was preserved. This religious school was built in the nineteenth century.
                In essence, it’s a large-scale complex, which also includes a mosque and a minaret, from which
                the muezzins called on believers to pray and gather. The complex occupies an area of 1.5 hectares.
                Moreover, the length of the madrasa itself, which is more than 120 m, is really amazing.

            <div class="descr">
                If you want to go shopping, you’d better choose central markets (bazars) over shops.
                The choice of products is wider and the prices are lower there. So what should you buy?
                First, of course – molded ceramics and pottery, which Andijan has been famous for since old times.
