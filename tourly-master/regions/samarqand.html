            <div class="title"></div>
            <div class="descr">
                By far one of the most popular places to visit in Samarkand, the Registan was the very heart of the ancient city.
                It has gained worldwide fame with its grand architecture, and no trip to Samarkand is complete without spending at least a few hours here.
                The three madrasahs are Islamic schools of distinctive architecture. From left to right, we have Ulugh Beg Madrasah, Tilya-Kori Madrasah and Sher-Dor Madrasah.

            <div class="title"></div>
            <div class="descr">
                Siab bazaar (also known as Siyob Bazaar) is the oldest and largest bazaar in Samarkand,
                and is literally next door to Bibi-Khanym Mosque.
                Over time the bazaar has been modernised but still has its unique and interesting charm.
                After you have finished visiting Bibi-Khanym Mosque, head next door through the massive arches and you will be in the bazaar.

            <div class="descr">
                The Afrasiab Ancient Site is one of the largest archaeological sites in the world.
                The ancient city was occupied from 500 BC to 1220AD but destroyed by the Mongols in the 13th century.
                Afrasiyab is the oldest part of the ancient city of Samarkand and covers 220 hectares.
                If you love history, this museum tells the story of life, culture and traditions of the people who lived in the area and in the different eras.

            <div class="descr">
                Gur-e-Amir means ‘Tomb of the King’ in Persian and is the final resting place of Timur himself,
                along with his two sons, two grandsons, and his personal teacher.
                Tamerlane’s grandson, Muhammad Sultan, was actually the reason
                Gur-e-Amir complex was built in the 14th century, as his sudden death meant he needed a place to be buried.
